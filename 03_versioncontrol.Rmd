## Why version control?

With git version control you can:

1. Keep a **history** of all the changes you have made to your code.
2. Be able to **revert** to an old version, or briefly look around in old code, or find any code you have written in at some time in the past.
3. **Undo** fatal coding mistakes.

## Why version control?

With git version control you can:

4. **Avoid multiple versions** of the same script (`myscrip_v1.R`, `myscript_v1_mod2.R` etc.)
5. Keep code clean, deleting commented-out code that you no longer need.
6. **Collaborate** with others on the same code, and easily merge the changes you and your collaborators make.
7. Maintain an **online backup** of your code base, and allow easy **sharing** of that code with others.



## git : manage the files in a folder

* With git, each folder can have its own git "repository"
* The repository is stored in a hidden subfolder (`.git`)

![](screenshots/gitfolder.png)

* Here, git can *see* all the changes to files in the root ("main.R") and all its subfolders (R, data, output, ...).
* You have to decide which files to "track" (and you can *ignore* others)


## Basics of git (2)

* Changes to the files are not 'saved' automatically, you have to decide when you want to store a snapshot of the files in your repository.
* To do so, you **stage** edited (or added) files, then **commit** them to the repository.
* You can decide which changes to keep, and which ones to discard.

The first time you "initialize" git in a folder.

Empty folders are not shown. 



## What to track?

* A good rule of thumb is to **only track code, not outputs or data**

* Typically only track text-based files (`.R`, `.txt`), not binary files (`.pdf`, `.docx`). 

* Every time git stores a snapshot of your repository, it includes a new copy of the changed files.
* For text-based files, it only stores the *difference* with the previous version (the "diff").
* If binary files are included, the size of the repository will grow quickly and become impractical.


## Local and remote repositories

git repositories are **always local**, and optionally you can sync with a remote repository

* Saving snapshots of your changes (**committing**) is done on your computer
* Optionally, you can send these changes to a remote repository (**push**)
* The remote acts as a mirror of your local repository
* You can also fetch changes in the remote not on your computer (**pull**)
* These changes can be from a collaborator, or from yourself on another computer

## git, github, bitbucket

* *git* is the actual version control system
* *github.com* and *bitbucket.org* are websites that host online git repositories
* These websites are **not** needed for version control, only to keep a remote copy of your code


## git and Rstudio

* Rstudio has a convenient GUI to use basic functionality of git
* You can also use *git* from the command line, which we need sometimes.
* Also, when you have *many* files in your repository to stage, the Rstudio menu can be very slow
