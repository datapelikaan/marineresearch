## Important basic skills for the R programmer

- Use Rstudio projects to manage your work
- Some Rstudio basic tips & tricks
- Make your code readable: format your code / write comments
- Name things well
- Organize your files into a logical folder structure
- Managing R package dependencies



## Rstudio projects


- A typical 'project' consists of many related files in a directory
- To run your code in this directory, you will typically have done:

```
setwd("c:/users/remkoduursma/projects/importantproject1")
```

- **Problem** : your code will not work on another computer!

- **Solution** : Rstudio projects

See [Section 1.9](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/intro.html#rstudio-projects)

## Make your code readable

- demo

## Name everything (well)

It is really important to name everything carefully, to end up with readable scripts:

**Don't** do this:

- Very general names (`data`, `summary`, `dataset`)
- Very short names (`d`, `y`, `y2`)
- Using special characters (use only letters, numbers, and  `_`)

**Do** this:

- For all objects and functions you write, use *snake_case*

`read_almere_parking_data`, `convert_date_to_time`, `to_sql_string`, `figure1`

- Use descriptive names, making clear what the object does or represents.



## Folder structure

When it comes to organizing the various files in your project, you have options.
But it is important to:

- Keep *code*, *data*, and *outputs* separate at all times. 

A (very!) minimal example:

In this example, we have a main script (`analysis.R`), which runs the analysis. 
All other files are collected in sub-folders.




## Managing R package dependencies


- see [Chapter 8](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/masteringpackages.html) in a Learning Guide to R.
