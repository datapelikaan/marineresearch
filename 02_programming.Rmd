## Important basic skills for the R programmer

- Use Rstudio projects to manage your work
- Some Rstudio basic tips & tricks
- Name things well
- Make your code readable: format your code / write comments
- Organize your files into a logical folder structure
- Managing R package dependencies



## Rstudio projects


- A typical 'project' consists of many related files in a directory
- To run your code in this directory, you will typically have done:

```
setwd("c:/users/remkoduursma/projects/importantproject1")
```

- **Problem** : your code will not work on another computer!

- **Solution** : Rstudio projects

See [Section 1.9](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/intro.html#rstudio-projects)

## Name everything (well)

It is really important to name everything carefully, to end up with readable scripts:

**Don't** do this:

- Very general names (`data`, `summary`, `dataset`)
- Very short names (`d`, `y`, `y2`)
- Using special characters (use only letters, numbers, and  `_`)

**Do** this:

- For all objects and functions you write, use *snake_case*

`read_almere_parking_data`, `convert_date_to_time`, `to_sql_string`, `figure1`

- Use descriptive names, making clear what the object does or represents.



## Make your code readable


- Rstudio: Code/Reformat code
- Much better: the `styler` package. [See here](https://styler.r-lib.org/)

- Demo



## Folder structure

When it comes to organizing the various files in your project, you have options.
But it is important to:

- Keep *code*, *data*, and *outputs* separate at all times. 

A (very!) minimal example:

![](screenshots/folderstructuresmall.png)  


In this example, we have a main script (`analysis.R`), which runs the analysis. 
All other files are collected in sub-folders.

## Working with folders in R


Never use full paths to files, for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Don't do this.
# It breaks our idea of reproducibility:
# this folder does not exist on another machine.
mydata <- read.csv("c:/users/remko/project1/data/bestand1.csv")
```

Use the *relative* path to access files:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mydata <- read.csv("rawdata/bestand1.csv")
```

Remember that with **Rstudio projects**, the default working directory is the location of the `myproject.Rproj` file.



## Managing R package dependencies


- see [Chapter 8](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/masteringpackages.html) in a Learning Guide to R.
