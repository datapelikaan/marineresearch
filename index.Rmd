#### Project management

In this presentation, I summarize and illustrate ten properties of "good" R projects.

#### Example Project

Take a look at an example project which demonstrates many of the concepts in the presentation on project management. 

[Example Project on Github](https://github.com/RemkoDuursma/almereparking)

Not included in the repository is a configuration file ([download it here](data/config.yml)), it needs to be placed in a subdirectory `conf/` in the project (the project runs without it though).


#### Writing functions

To follow in the next workshop.



#### Reading

More background reading on project management, git version control, R package management, programming, and many other topics:
