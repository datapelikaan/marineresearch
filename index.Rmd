This temporary website accompanies the workshop at *WUR Marine Research*, 5 and 19 March 2020.



### Workshop materials

For this course we follow selected chapters from :

<span style="font-size: 1.4em">[A Learning Guide to R](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor)</span>

by [Remko Duursma](https://www.remkoduursma.com)

Depending on interest in the group and time, I will demonstrate selected sections from the following chapters:

- [Chapter 4 : R Programming: Lists, Functions, and Loops](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/programming.html)
- [Chapter 6 : Version control with git and Rstudio](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/versioncontrol.html)
- [Chapter 7 : R Project management](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/projectman.html)
- [Chapter 8 : Mastering R Package Dependencies](https://remkoduursma.github.io/learningguidetor/rpackages.html)

Feel free to browse the rest of the book.

The **printable** version of the book can be found via a PDF icon link in the online book.

Solutions to the exercises (though I expect you will be working on your own project) [can be found here](compiled_html/lgr_exercises.html).

#### Example Project

I will demonstrate some key concepts in an example project shared with me by Floor Soudijn. We also will use the project to practice collaborating via *git* version control. 

The repository is available here (it will only be publicly available during the course):
